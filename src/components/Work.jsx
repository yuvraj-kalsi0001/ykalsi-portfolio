It uses Spring Boot microservices (user, activity, gateway), React frontend, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ for messaging, and Google Gemini API for generating workout summaries. I led backend integration and token-based Keycloak auth setup.",

    <>
      As co-developer at SmartBin Technologies, I worked on <strong>AiWatch</strong> â€” an AI-powered behavioral monitoring system for RCMP holding cells. After successfully clearing Phase 1 of funding through Innovative Solutions Canada, we are now developing a functional prototype. AiWatch uses real-time video analytics and machine learning to detect medical emergencies, aggressive behavior, and mental health risks among detainees. I contributed to designing detection logic and building the web-based dashboard for reviewing and managing alerts.{" "}

      "As a research assistant at Memorial University's DIAG labs, I deployed HTCondor across cloud virtual machines and the Compute Canada supercluster. I integrated Slurm with HTCondor using Apptainer containers and wrote Bash automation scripts to manage biomedical image pipelines for parallel execution at scale. I also presented this work at the MUN Scientific Endeavours in Academia (SEA) Conference as part of my honours thesis. ",

It includes country-wise launch filters, orbit breakdowns, and time-series plots to visualize public and commercial space race developments. This project was presented as part of my data visualization coursework.",

      "This project is a PHP and MySQL-based Library Management System that provides a web interface for managing common library operations. The codebase includes features for user authentication, book requests, issuance, and returns, along with an admin dashboard for adding or deleting books, managing users, and approving requests. The backend logic is handled in PHP files that interact with a MySQL database (via db.php), while library_managment.sql defines the schema and initial data. Frontend presentation is managed with HTML and CSS, and uploaded files (such as book images) are stored in dedicated directories. The system demonstrates CRUD operations, role-based functionality (admin vs. user), and integration of PHP with MySQL for a practical web application.",
